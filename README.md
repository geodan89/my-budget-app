# my-budget-app

Creating a Spring Boot app for expense and budget monitoring. Creating Rest Api.

Api Documentation: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/G9538/mybudgetapp/0.1


The Api Docs has been created as part of an exercise while taking a course on OpenApi, the app is not deployed yet on any server, once you clone the code, set-up the database on your machine and then run the app locally, you can use the Api Docs as a guideline to make calls on localhost://8080 using Postman.
The Api Documentation has been created using Swagger Hub, I've written it in YAML.
