Creating a Spring Boot app for expense and budget monitoring. Creating Rest Api.

Api Documentation: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/G9538/budgetapp/0.1

The Api Docs have been created as part of an exercise while taking a course on OpenApi, the app is not deployed yet on any server, once you clone the code, set-up the database on your machine, you can use the Api Docs as a guideline to make calls on localhost://8080 using Postman.
